Applicable:

The Factory Method pattern is beneficial when you don't know the exact types and dependencies of objects your code should work with. It separates product construction code from the
code that uses the product, enabling easier extension of the product construction independently. This pattern is especially useful when you want to provide users
with a way to extend the internal components of a library or framework. It's also effective in scenarios where you aim to save system resources by reusing existing
objects, such as database connections or network resources.

Pros and Cons:
    Pros:
        Avoids Tight Coupling:
            Avoids tight coupling between the creator and concrete products.

    Single Responsibility Principle:
        Product creation code is centralized, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

    Open/Closed Principle:
        Allows introducing new types of products without breaking existing client code.

    Ideal for Existing Hierarchies:
        The Factory Method pattern integrates well into existing class hierarchies, making it easier to extend and adapt the codebase.
        It allows for the introduction of new product types without modifying existing client code.

    Cons:
        Increased Code Complexity:
            The code may become more complicated due to the need for introducing multiple subclasses.

Relations with Other Patterns:
    Evolution of Designs:
        Many designs start with Factory Method and may evolve towards Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder, depending on complexity and flexibility requirements.

    Abstract Factory and Prototype:
        Abstract Factory classes often use a set of Factory Methods, and Prototype can be used to compose methods on these classes.

    Factory Method and Iterator:
        Factory Method can be used along with Iterator to let collection subclasses return different types of iterators compatible with the collections.

    Prototype vs. Factory Method:
        Prototype isn't based on inheritance and avoids its drawbacks, but it requires complicated initialization of the cloned object. Factory Method is based on inheritance but doesn't require an initialization step.

    Factory Method as a Template Method Specialization:
        Factory Method is a specialization of Template Method, and it may serve as a step in a large Template Method.
