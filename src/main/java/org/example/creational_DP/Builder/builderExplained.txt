Usage:

The Builder pattern is beneficial when dealing with a "telescopic constructor," a constructor with numerous optional parameters.
Creating overloaded constructors to handle different parameter combinations can become unwieldy. The Builder pattern allows you to build objects step by step,
utilizing only the necessary steps and eliminating the need for overloaded constructors.

Use the Builder pattern when:
You want your code to create different representations of a product (e.g., kids meal and regular meal, stone and wooden houses).
The construction of various representations of a product involves similar steps that differ only in details.
You need to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
The Builder pattern enables you to construct products step-by-step, defer execution of some steps without breaking the final product, and call steps recursively for building object trees.

Pros:
    Construction Step Control:
        Construct objects step-by-step, deferring or recursively executing steps.
        Prevent fetching incomplete results, as a builder doesn't expose the unfinished product during construction.

    Code Reusability:
        Reuse the same construction code for building various representations of products.

    Single Responsibility Principle:
        Isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product.

Cons:
    Increased Code Complexity:
        The overall complexity of the code increases due to the creation of multiple new classes.

Relations with Other Patterns:
Many designs start with Factory Method and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder for increased flexibility.
Builder focuses on constructing complex objects step by step, while Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects immediately.
Builder is suitable for creating complex Composite trees with recursive construction steps.
Combination with Bridge: The director class plays the role of abstraction, and different builders act as implementations.
Abstract Factories, Builders, and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons.
